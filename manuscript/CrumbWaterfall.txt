# Crumb Waterfall

His standing desk was mess. Pumpkin, his girlfriend's Cocker Spaniel, lounged below the crumb waterfall as Alan O'Reily took another disinterested bite of his tempeh bowl and wrote a text message in his permanent smart phone slouch. After years of database administration, Alan had refined his already introverted disposition into a samurai sword of stored procedures, shell scripts, and emoji. When his display lit up early in the morning with a phone call from an unfamiliar area code, he instinctively blocked the call and continued writing his text message.

Later in the afternoon, an email indicated to him that the phone call and subsequent voicemail had been from his old fraternity brother Josh "The Martian" Martin. Josh was offering him a position as an engineering manager and a significant amount of equity in his new tech startup. The lifestyle sounded incredible. Unlimited vacation, free beer at the office, and dogs were allowed! He would no longer have to work remotely from his dimly lit apartment in Hoboken. O'Reilly agreed to come aboard as the engineering manager, but he couldn't make it out there for another month and a half.

Alan stepped over his zafu as he walked his half eaten tempeh bowl over to the kicthen. Pumpkin watched, without lifting her chin up from the linoleum. With one hand, he set his bowl in the sink, while the other stroked a paddle mounted on the wall. He and Josh had won the doubles ping pong tournament championship in college. The idea of managing a team was terrifying to him, but his bond with Josh gave him comfort. In one awkward motion he swooped by his computer and typed "afk" to his friends in IRC, closed his eyes, and rang his kundalini gong. As Alan took tree pose in the center of his aparment, the vibrations slowly faded away, leaving only the sound of his turbo fan.
