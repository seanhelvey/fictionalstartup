# Leaves and Dirt

As she meandered through the forest in Vermont the following summer, Lazuli continued thinking about the possibility of building the Dream Machine with Josh and Sally in Aimesville. What if the contraption could change the world, as Sally had suggested. She hadn't considered the impact that the device might have, because she had been so focused on the design. When she walked through the forest, she would simply place one foot in front of the other, not heading for any particular destination. Barefoot in the summer months, hardly any sound could be heard coming from her feet against the leaves and dirt. She knew the area around her parents' cottage extremely well. In spite of this, Lazuli always found a branch or meadow that she hadn't noticed before, and saw each day differently depending on the light.

She found herself perched on top of a large boulder which appeared slightly out of place. There was a puddle of water which looked like mercury and she dipped her finger in and out of the puddle, watching the waves disperse perfectly across the surface. Laying down now and looking up into maple leaves, sun rays glimmered past her nose. Harmonic ratios eminated through the air as two hermit thrush sang back and forth to one another. She followed the song and it lead her gaze toward a nest full of hungry baby thrush. For hours, the parents slavishly searched for food and tended to their brood.

She drafted an immaculate hand written letter to the team in Aimesville that evening, indicating that she had made her decision, and would be relocating to join them in the Fall.
