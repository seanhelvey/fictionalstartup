# Intro

They were 30 seconds away from being consumed by the largest computer software company in the world. The startup had run out of cash. The legendary venture capitalist Bill Farnsworth was sitting on their branded couch drinking water from a branded glass and looking extremely upset in his branded t-shirt while going through the company's limited number of options together with founders Josh Martin and Sally Greenfield, who were wearing branded hoodies. Their one paying customer had grown tired of them over promising and under delivering. Version 2 of the dream machine didn't live up to their expectations; It had too many bugs and not enough features. It seemed as if it could have been built by one person, but the company had a whole team of engineers, according to their website. Lazuli was working in the engineering room with the lights off, but the door was cracked and she could hear everything.

# Light Speed

The startup community in Aimesville was thriving. When Bill Farnsworth arrived and created "Light Speed", the world's first business accelerator, the city transformed from a quiet cow-town into a technology Mecca. Bill studied theoretical physics in Pasadena (He referred to the location instead of the name of the university, to avoid sounding pretentious) and had worked in venture capital from the age of 18, thanks to a deep network of wealthy family members in the industry and an inheritance from his grandfather. Since the dot-com bust, he hadn't hit any real home runs with his early stage portfolio companies. Bill had just returned from his 5th expedition of the season. He was a thrill seeker and the lack of 10x investment returns recently had lead him to pursue hobbies including but not limited to arctic exploration, brewing tequila, and filmmaking. [illustrate bill doing hobby - maybe have him conference call in from somewhere]

Josh Martin had been formally trained in economics, but was also the president of his fraternity and captain of the lacrosse team at Denver State University. He thrived at the globally renown consulting firm Jenkins & Bartleby, leading a series of complicated restructuring transactions which resulted in record results for the company and its investors. Josh had the peculiar habit sitting back with his feet on the desk and making notes in his journal with a freshly sharpened number two pencil for the first hour of his morning every day. He somehow managed to drink coffee from a mug, carry on conversations with his employees, and continue with his routine journaling, without losing his balance in the chair.

Sally Greenfield studied marketing at McWilliams College and had an uncanny knack for telling stories. She too started her career at Jenkins & Bartleby, but would eventually leave to create WunderHaus, which soon became the poster child for socially conscious business, in spite of the year over year losses and disgruntled shareholders. Sally was always smiling and wearing egregious amounts of red lipstick. Her marble eyes had an eternally optimistic expression, the persistence of which was actually quite frightening, once you had gotten to know her and experienced the organizational turmoil that was her life. It wasn't clear whether the joke about her cat being lost inside of her purse was really a joke, because the bag would appear to move on its own occasionally. Something that sounded like a meow could be heard coming from it during meetings.

Josh and Sally had talked about starting a business since they ate lunch together during their first day as interns at Jenkins. Josh always admired Sally's ability to captivate an audience, while she longed to have the cold and calculated approach that Josh had perfected. Josh and Sally were both married and their spouses were very supportive of their platonic relationship. In their early days at Jenkins, Josh and Sally worked on a project together and slept under their respective desks for 2 weeks straight. Sally's husband enjoyed the freedom of holding the remote control and cleaned the house incessantly while she was away. Josh sent Sally a link to a viral blog post about Light Speed one day which prompted a visit Aimesville the following spring. They both wanted to change the world and executing this vision was going to require a significant amount of capital.

They happened to be visiting Aimesville during their annual startup bash where companies hosted events highlighting their entrepreneurial culture. Every conversation seemed to revolve around Farnsworth and his accelerator, Light speed. The most coveted startups around town were all in Farnsworth portfolio. Founders and employees all had cool t-shirts and stickers on their laptops. They were "always hiring" and "growing like crazy". The energy was infectious. Sally was sharing pictures on social media the entire time and wrote a frenetic blog post after the first day of events titled "Aimesville or Bust" in which she declared that Aimesville was the Dubai of the mid-west and likened Light Speed to Dubai's artificial palm tree shaped islands which branched out into the ocean.

# The Dream Machine

Lazuli Masterson was a prodigious cellist and had become a sensation in her community of Mccamish, Vermont by the age of four. In addition to music, she was a gifted artist and displayed advanced writing abilities. She began editing the Mccamish Bugle at the age of 13 and started a hedge fund with her earnings from the paper. Her own algorithm "Lazuli's latter" was the subject of her Master's thesis in semiotics which she completed at the age of 21. She had toyed with virtual reality headsets and wanted to create a seamless experience where people could enter a beautiful dreamlike state through the use of technology. Lazuli was visiting Aimesville in the Spring too, because she had read the same viral blog post.

Lazuli felt slightly more introverted than usual at these events. When she met Sally Greenfield, she was surprised that they had so much in common. Lazuli Masterson wasn't someone who wore a lot of makeup to get attention. She expressed pristine thoughts and built magnificent systems, which according to Sally Greenfield, was exactly what she and Josh Martin were doing with their startup. They needed talented engineers like her if they were going to change the world, she explained. Lazuli felt marginally more comfortable talking with Josh, and he was sincerely impressed with her ideas on artificial intelligence and virtual reality. When she revealed her idea for the dream machine, he was floored. The following morning his journal entry was focused on the economic reality of building a dream machine.

As she meandered through the forest in Vermont that summer, Lazuli continued thinking about the possibility of building the dream machine with Greenfield and Martin in Aimesville. What if the contraption could change the world, as Sally had suggested. She hadn't considered the impact that the device might have, because she had been so focused on the design. When she walked through the forest, she would simply place one foot in front of the other, not heading for any particular destination. Barefoot in the summer months, hardly and sound could be heard coming from her feet against the leaves and dirt. She knew the area around her parents' cottage extremely well. In spite of this, Lazuli always found a new branch or meadow that she hadn't noticed before, and saw each day differently depending on the day's light and weather.

She found herself perched on top of a large boulder which appeared slightly out of place. There was a puddle of water which looked like mercury and she dipped her finger in and out of the puddle, watching the waves disperse perfectly across the surface. Laying down now and looking up into maple leaves, sun rays glimmered right past the front of her nose. Harmonic ratios eminated through the air as two hermit thrush sang back and forth to one another. She drafted an immaculate hand written letter to the team in Aimesville that evening, indicating that she had made her decision, and would be relocating to join them in the Fall.

# (Ad)venture

Josh had been reading Farnsworth's blog "(Ad)venture" for weeks, so he knew that Bill liked to be called by his first name, and was more than prepared to answer any questions that he had about the dream machine. Bill and Sally made eye contact the second he walked into the coffee shop. For a venture capitalist, Bill Farnsworth seemed surprisingly down to earth. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt with baggy shorts, leather sandals, and reading glasses with Photochromic lenses. Bill purchased a coffee and sat down, thinking that this team seemed to have a special quality, and wondering whether they were capable of producing 10x returns.

Before Bill could say a word, Sally burst into a an somewhat longwinded story about.. Well, Bill wasn't 100% certain what exactly the story was about. He knew that the two of them seemed like winners and believed that they would figure it out if they had the right amount of resources and mentorship along the way. She mentioned issues like domestic violence, malaria, and obesity, as she weaved her way through the history of technology and what it can accomplish for society. Josh was more explicit when he spoke, drawing a picture of the dream machine and a graph illustrating exponential revenue growth in his journal for Farnsworth. The two of them had ordered dream machine t-shirts and paid extra to have them printed overnight. It was a convincing performance, and by the end of the conversation, they had tentatively secured a spot in the next group of Light Speed portfolio companies.

# O'Reily

His standing desk was mess. Pumpkin, his girlfriend's Cocker Spaniel, lounged below the crumb waterfall as Alan O'Reilly took another disinterested bite of his tempeh bowl and wrote a text message in his permanent smart phone slouch. After years of database administration, Alan had refined his already introverted disposition into a samurai sword of stored procedures and shell scripts. When his display lit up early in the morning with a phone call from an unfamiliar 809 area code, he instinctively blocked the call and continued writing his text message.

Later in the afternoon, an email indicated to him that the phone call and subsequent voicemail had been from his old fraternity brother Josh "The Martian" Martin. Josh was offering him a position as an Engineering Manager and a significant amount of equity in his new tech startup. The lifestyle sounded incredible. Unlimited vacation, free beer at the office, and dogs were allowed! He would no longer have to work remotely from his dimly lit apartment. O'Reilly agreed to come aboard as the Engineering Manager, but he couldn't make it out there for another month and a half.

# Acceleration

Demo day was rapidly approaching now, and the last 6 weeks of the accelerator program had been far more intense than Greenfield and Martin had anticipated. Josh took it upon himself to live up to the Light Speed motto of "Sell First Build Fast" and whipped up a prototype of the dream machine that probably caused at least three different types of cancer when actually used by a person. It consisted of a microcontroller attached to a pair of safety goggles and contained only 1,000 lines of code, but the financial story made sense. If they sold 200 of them this year and 5000 next year, a second round of investment could value the company at approximately 10x the initial investment provided by Light Speed. 5 of the 6 weeks were spent ironing out their presentation for demo day and most of their budget went toward an elaborate video production which would show off features which hadn't yet been built.

The dream machine demo had been a raging success, and the company raised twice the original amount of funding in the following week, through connections provided by Farnsworth. They only had one paying client using the prototype, but now that O'Reilly was in town, they had hired several software developers to build out version 2 of the product. The team worked night and day throughout the summer, taking breaks for ping pong occasionally, and drinking copious amounts of beer. The big joke on the team was the company across the street. They had been around for 20 years, long before Light Speed, and their plain office lacked all of the amenities that were available at the dream machine office. Josh, Alan, and the engineering team got wasted one night and toilet papered the company across the street.

# Features and Demos

Lazuli was surprised at the amount of toilet paper that littered the streets on the morning that she arrived in Aimesville. She was so excited about building her dream machine, that she had come straight into the bright blue office from the airport, without even seeing her new apartment. She rang the doorbell which had been reprogrammed to produce an elongated fart sound at the company's last hackathon. One of the engineers answered the door and showed her to her desk in the engineering room. The engineers resumed their conversation about the prototype, saying that Josh and Sally had no idea how bad it actually was. Apparently they needed to refactor code and add tests, but the founders are so focused on new features and demos, the engineers never have time to do things right.

That evening, Lazuli overheard an argument between the engineer who had been there the longest and Josh. The engineer said that Alan was useless as a manager and Sally was driving the team nuts with shifting priorities and impossible deadlines. He was completely burnt out by completing repetitive tasks and thinking about leaving the company. Josh had his feet up on his desk and was taking notes in his journal as the young engineer continued to vent. Josh didn't appreciate the slandering of his former fraternity brother, Alan, and thought that the kid was way out of line. Alan was oblivious to the conversation, standing at his desk in the engineering room, reading a text message.

The engineer left that evening, slamming the door, and ringing the elongated fart doorbell three times on the way out. The rest of the team didn't feel any loyalty to Alan or Josh, so they decided not to come back the following day. Alan still hadn't personally introduced himself to Lazuli, but he did send her an email, assuring her that her job was safe. Lazuli slept under her desk that night because she had been inundated with bug fixes the second she arrived. She stayed up the entire night trying to figure out the system, but wasn't making much progress.

Lazuli thought about how Pumpkin must feel sitting under Alan's crumb waterfall as she layed on the carpet that night. Her cheek burned slightly from its rough texture, so she rolled up a hoodie for a pillow, and used another one as a blanket. There was pressure against her hip and shoulder when she was on her side, but she couldn't sleep on her back either. It was quiet in the office. She dreamt about one difficult bug that she couldn't fix that day. In her dream, the answer was obvious, but her clunky arms and numb hands wouldn't allow her to solve it.

# Weird Feedback

The following day Lazuli received another email from Alan that they were one month late on delivering version 2 of the dream machine, and company's biggest client was going to terminate their contract if it wasn't delivered by Friday. There was no time for code reviews or automated tests. Why was she writing a test for each of her bug fixes? He mentioned that her productivity metrics over the past couple of days had been sub par, and that Josh had said the feedback she gave on her first survey response seemed a little weird. She wasn't aware that the automated surveys she filled out were distributed to the management team, so she decided to be less honest in the surveys, and became much more fearful about her future there.

Instead of wasting money on engineers who were just going to walk out the door, Josh and Sally decided to hire a young man by the name of Aaron Roberts to head up a client services group. Aaron had his own office on the other side of the building and wasn't allowed to interrupt the engineers with any questions about the prototype. Sally also hired a Director of Marketing to focus on new clients and a Product Manager to do something that Lazuli didn't understand. Both of the new hires were members of the Leadership Team along with Josh, Sally, and Alan.

After working all day Wednesday and Thursday without going home to her apartment, Lazuli stumbled across the street in search of food. One of the engineers from the company across the street noticed her branded shirt and asked how she liked it over there. When she dodged the question and inquired about his job, he replied enthusiastically, inviting her to lunch with his team. She didn't have time for lunch with the Friday deadline looming in her mind, but she was too tired to come up with an excuse, and ate lunch with the company across the street.

Their manager smiled and made eye contact with Lazuli when she met her. Her engineers explained that they were all happy and the best talent came to work there, just based on word of mouth. They only had a few clients and one product, but their customers were so pleased with their product, that they sent thank you notes and told all of their friends about it. Engineers were encouraged to fix bugs at their own discretion and take time to refactor code. The team pair programmed often and shared responsibility to avoid burning out and cultivate new skills. Developers worked directly with marketing and product team members and were even allowed to communicate with clients.

Lazuli took a business card from the engineering manager from the company across the street and sauntered back to the office. She rang the doorbell, but it was 5 minutes before someone came and opened the door for her. Josh opened the door and walked silently back into a conference room where the Leadership Team was having a heated discussion. Sally could be heard clanking across the conference room in her heels.

# A Sales Driven Organization

"It isn't a problem anymore, Josh! Developers come and go, but the vision remains the same. We are a sales driven organization. Who gives a damn about the bugs in version 2. Version 3 is going to change all of that. We have Aaron now, so engineers won't have to deal with any interruptions from clients. We have a new Director of Marketing and a Product Manager. Tell the code school we can gaurantee 3 students full-time jobs this fall. We need one front-end, one back-end, and someone who does dev ops."

Josh knew that Sally was right, and loved her focus. One client wasn't enough.

"We need more clients. Bigger clients. 10x returns. If Farnsworth finds out that our projections for the next couple of years aren't growing exponentially, he is going to pull the rug out from under us. Can you imagine sinking half a million dollars into a business and seeing losses quarter after quarter?"

She worked in the engineering room with the lights off for the rest of the evening before hearing Bill Farnsworth's voice booming through the office. Bill had let himself in and put an abrupt end to the Leadership Team meeting. He wanted to know more about version 2 of the dream machine. His tone was dominant and Lazuli could feel the tension building through the walls of the engineering room. She clicked her keys softly and felt the nerves in her neck become tense. She wasn't laying on the floor, but could feel the burning senstation of the carpet on her cheek. Her left hand was tingling.

"I want what you promised me 6 months ago, Josh! One client? I thought you two were winners. I told every one of my friends during your demo that you were going to be the company this year. You guys. I lined up investors who gave you mentorship like parents. Where are you now? 10 engineers and this is the best that you can do? Where is the revenue growth?"

It was Thursday evening now, and in spite of the branded couch, glasses, shirts, and hoodies, the company was on the brink of losing their only client and running out of money.

# Negative Attitude

/* Peak */

Instead of sleeping under her desk in the engineering room that night, she stayed up and worked on a presentation which she went over with the Leadership Team the following day. It was a culmination of everything that she had learned independently and in school over the course of her life. Lazuli was very capable of solving all of their problems. She made pointed suggestions to Alan and Josh based on the teachings of Deming, Brooks, and other authors that she admired such as Hermann Hesse. It made allusions to mythology, incorporated a tasteful amount of neuroscience, and featured examples based on quantum physics, in case Farnsworth decided to attend. She messaged Alan the following morning when he became available online.

7:30 AM
Lazuli: Hey Alan! Are you getting together with The Leadership Team today? If so, what time?

8:57 AM
O'Reily: yeah right now what's up

8:58 AM
Lazuli: I'd like to share some thoughts with you. Is it ok for me to come?

11:15 AM
O'Reily: finishing up now why

11:16 AM
Lazuli: I just think there are some things we can do to be more productive and I want to get your feedback.

2:15 AM
O'Reily: let's talk this afternoon

They didn't talk in the afternoon.

//////// time passes?

Lazuli was fired immediately after the presentation for having a negative attitude. The company's only customer renewed their contract that afternoon because the client services group lead by Aaron Roberts had assuaged their concerns about bugs in version 2. The Director of Marketing and Product Manager painted a picture of new features coming out next year that was just irresistible for the client. They didn't even want version 2 of the dream machine anymore, because version 3 sounded so extraordinary.

Lazuli went home to her new apartment for the first time and slept the entire weekend. She emailed the company across the street on Monday morning, and was offered a contract position for a couple of weeks, before they took her on full-time as a software developer. She ran into Alan in the street one day and he explained that Farnsworth had decided to double down his investment in the company. They were on a hiring spree again and had already brought on five new developers while gearing up for version 3.

# The Company Across the Street

Lazuli stayed at the company across the street for years and eventually became the lead developer. She approached her work there with the same fervor that she had exhibited learning to play the cello as a child, editing the newspaper in her teens, creating her hedge fund, and mastering semiotics in grad school. Leading the team was a new experience for her though. She strived to be a servant leader, proactively guiding and helping her teammates. Lazuli kept her team small and empowered each of them to make decisions about whether we needed refactoring, more tests, bug fixes, or new features. The engineers worked in unison with other departments.

Her original ideas about the dream machine were vastly different than the horrible version 2 prototype that she had worked on. She envisioned a divinely elegant system which would coax people into a dreamlike state, not a pair of virtual reality goggles. She hired a lawyer to hash out any potential issues with intellectual property and then brought her splendid invention into being. An angelic headband delivered transcranial magnetic stimulation which could help people with a variety of brain disorders. Lazuli found that wearing the headband before sleeping helped her brain feel rested in the morning. The local university was studying her prototype to confirm its safety and analyze all of its potential uses.

Lazuli never saw the need for venture capital. She bootstrapped her side project and did her best to make it affordable for other people as well. Her L1 cost hardly anything to produce and became readily available as a medical device around the world, eventually earning her a nobel prize. She traveled the world as a celebrity, and eventually moved bad to Vermont, settling down and starting a family. A judge ruled in her favor when Martin and Greenfield challenged her patents in court. The mechanism behind the L1 was wholly unique compared with anything that could be found in the dream machine.

# New Doorbell

One day, the building that had been branded bright blue was painted grey and the custom doorbell was replaced. An article in the newspaper featuring Sally Greenfield explained that they had been acquired by the largest computer software company in the world in a heroic exit which embodied the characteristic acumen of Aimesville and the entrepreneurial community there. The co-founders didn't make much money in the deal, and neither did Farnsworth, but the story had a nice ring to it. After two years with the large computer software company, they decided to leave and create another successful startup to change the world again.
