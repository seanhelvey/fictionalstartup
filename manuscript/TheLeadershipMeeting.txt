# The Leadership Meeting

Jake arrived 5 minutes late after a call with clients wrapped up. The meowing sound coming from Sally's bag was muddled by the conversation that Josh and Alan were having. They had been going back and forth for weeks about which email system would be best for team. Lazuli would be integrating the system, but wasn't consulted for her input. She smiled and presented her slides to the team, who seemed to be shocked by what she considered to be relatively obvious suggestions.

Alan was deeply offended when she suggested that someone need to refine their engineering process. Time was being wasted dealing with poorly defined issues and changing requirements? He thought time was being wasted sitting in this meeting listening to Lazuli! Sally had a quiet discussion with the director of marketing and the new product manager in the corner, ignoring the presentation entirely. She missed all of Lazuli's suggestions for new features that could have made the company millions. Sally would shoot a frowny face at Lazuli periodically through the corner of her smoldering eyes. What exactly was she complaining about?

Lazuli was fired immediately after the presentation for having a bad attitude. Everyone preferred Larry's upbeat style, and felt like Lazuli was just a negative person, who had a toxic effect on their culture. The company's only customer renewed their contract that afternoon because Jake and the client services group had assuaged their concerns about bugs in version 2. The director of marketing and product manager painted a picture of new features coming out next year that was just irresistible. They didn't even want version 2 of the Dream Machine anymore, because version 3 sounded so extraordinary.
