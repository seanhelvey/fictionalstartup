# Back on The Horse

She settled into her apartment that weekend, pulling items out of boxes, and hanging tapestries. Since she hadn't purchased any coffee or tea for her place yet, she wandered down to one of the many local coffee shops in Aimesville. Everyone was on their computer working on a startup.

Once she had ordered, she sat down and began to think about her next steps. Lazuli had six months before she needed to start making student loan payments, but she was hoping to save up some money in the meanwhile, and wanted more experience as a professional software developer. She searched "tech jobs in Aimesville" and found a developer job with Robertson Electronics. She found very little online about the company, but went ahead and completed the application anyway.

A guy turned and introduced himself to her at the coffee shop. "Wow," he stammered "you don't see many hot developer chicks! Is that what you do?" Lazuli was taken aback by this.

"Yes, I am a software developer." She affirmed, "A hot chick, um.. Let's just say no." He got the hint. She relocated to the library and after signing up for a card, began to peruse the fiction aisels. Barbara Kingsolver, Banana Yoshimoto, Elena Ferrante.. So many familiar authors, but no books that she hadn't read already. An obscure Jane Austen book caught her eye, and after crushing one chapter standing in the aisle, she proceded home happily with the book.

This continued for several weeks. She learned that there were many larger software companies in the area too, and an innumerable amount of opportunities at startups. She applied online, sent emails, and took phone calls. Some companies would ask her to come in and solve problems on a white board or complete code samples. Certain teams had positive vibes, while others just wanted to grill her and make her look stupid. She met one woman out of 15 interviews over the course of two weeks.
