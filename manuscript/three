# three

Josh had been reading Farnsworth's blog "VentureAdventure" for weeks, so he knew that Bill like to be called by his first name, and was more than prepared to answer any questions that he had about the dream machine. Bill and Sally made eye contact the second he walked into the coffee shop. For a venture capitalist, Bill Farnsworth seemed surprisingly down to earth. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt with baggy shorts, leather sandals, and reading glasses with Photochromic lenses. Bill purchased a coffee and sat down, thinking that this team seemed to have a special quality, and wondering whether they were capable of producing 10x returns.

Before Bill could say a word, Sally burst into a an somewhat longwinded story about.. Well, Bill wasn't 100% certain what exactly the story was about. He knew that the two of them seemed like winners and believed that they would figure it out if they had the right amount of resources and mentorship along the way. She mentioned issues like domestic violence, malaria, and obesity, as she weaved her way through the history of technology and what it can accomplish for society. Josh was more explicit when he spoke, drawing a picture of the dream machine and a graph illustrating exponential revenue growth in his journal for Farnsworth. The two of them had ordered dream machine t-shirts and paid extra to have them printed overnight. It was a convincing performance, and by the end of the conversation, they had tentatively secured a spot in the next group of Light Speed portfolio companies.
