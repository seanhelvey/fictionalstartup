# Code School Meltown

She grabbed an Aimesville Daily at the coffee shop that weekend. It was beginning to feel like winter now, so Lazuli ordered a cacao latte and indulged in the "Code School Meltdown" article featured on the front page. Aimesville Digital Arts and Einstein Camp had already shut down, being latecomers to the developer bootcamp scene. Reboot U was struggling financially, while Forge had been able to place 60% of its graduates this session, down from 100% the prior class.

Lazuli sat down with her back to someone who had a familiar voice. His chair could be heard creeking as he tilted back and jotted down notes while drinking coffee. "Exponential," Josh explained, "that is different than linear growth, Bill. Give us one year and enough money for six new developers and we can pump out the next version of the Dream Machine. It's what clients are waiting for."

You could sense Farnsworth's presence in the room. Every person that walked by either nodded at him, said hello, or whispered to their friend, "There he is. That's Bill Farnsworth!" Most of the people that she could see in the room had Light Speed t-shirts or stickers on their laptops.

"Six months and three new developers. I want version 3 done yesterday." Farnsworth declared, in a muted voice, placing his first firmly on the table, so that only Josh would be able to hear the sound. "We need to make an exit as soon as possible, Josh, and get some more money flowing into Light Speed. I can't afford an expedition this winter and my tequila business isn't doing too hot. This is it. Make it happen."
