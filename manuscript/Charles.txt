Charles.txt

Her brother Charles decided to visit Lazuli while she was funemployed. He was an artist who was obsessed with climbing, so the idea of catching up with his sister and spending some time out west seemed logical. Charles had been working on ceramics throughout the summer and had a week to kill before fall classes resumed.

Lazuli had always bouldered and scrambled, but this was her first time top roping, and she really enjoyed it. She found that focusing on using her legs was critical, as Charles had said, and that it was as much about balance as it was about strength. She gracefully danced toward the top like a gymnast, taking breaks to discuss ceramics and Jane Austen with Charles.

It wasn't long before the job offers started pouring in. Some companies had extended offers on the spot, in an effort to diversify their all male engineering teams. That was clear to her. Others had been impressed with her code samples or her whiteboarding skills. She thought the experience was pretty silly.
