# Regrets

"I'll never be that honest in a professional setting again," she said "I don't care how bad it is. Next time I'll just collect a paycheck and keep my mouth shut."

Lazuli's mother, Mary Shepherd, said that her manager sounded like an asshole and the founders didn't have a clue what they were doing. She shouldn't be so hard on herself. Her father, Fred, had seen Lazuli learn many valuable lessons through the years in Mccamish. "What was your biggest challenge editing the Bugle in high school, Lazuli? Was it writing?"

"Of course not, Dad. It was the people."

"That's right. And it isn't that you are bad at working with people, so don't think that for one second. This character.. What was his name, Alan? He sounds like a terrible leader! Your job at the Bugle wasn't writing a newspaper, was it Lazuli? It was helping your team write a newspaper."

Mary and Fred had met on an expedition in Borneo while working as field biologists during the 70's. Fred continued in academia while Mary raised Lazuli and her brother Charles. They were hippies, leading a sustainable life in rural Vermont. Her mother was a local feminist leader and her father supported her every step of the way. While he had specialized in arthropods, she was a botanist who also wrote fiction for many years.

"You know, there are Mother Trees in the forest that are connected to all of the other smaller trees through a network of fungal threads. Some baby trees hardly receive any sunlight at all, yet the Mother Trees communicate with them, and they survive together. That is leadership."

It was all coming back to Lazuli now. Giving back to the community with her non-profit, studying semiotics in college, and her ideas for a dream machine. Everything had been influenced by her parents.
