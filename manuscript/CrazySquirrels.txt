# Crazy Squirrels

Lazuli saw a rack of bikes available for rent when she exited the office building that afternoon. She instinctively swiped her card and pedaled over toward 5 mile creek. She was so sleepy that the entire scene was surreal, but her skin was crawling and there was the need to release energy. "Five miles meandering with a mazy motion," she thought, unable to recall whether that was a real line of poetry or delusion.

This was her first time seeing Aimesville outside of her brief visit for the Startup Bash and the time that she had spent working downtown. It was very different than Vermont. The bike paths were incredible, so she continued floating around town aimelessly. The phrase "Aimeless in Aimesville" occurred to her, and caused her to worry slightly about her mental health, but Lazuli rode on. The fever dream was lucid and delightful.

She plopped down into a bed of grass after scrambing around on some rocks as the sun was setting in the disance. The small boulders at the base of the hills ascended fractally toward two separate peaks, one considerably higher than the other. The air had a chill to it now, and the squirrels had begun acting crazy, the way that they do when winter is approaching. She watched one through the long blades of grass.
