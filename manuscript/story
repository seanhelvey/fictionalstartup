A talented software developer joins the vibrant startup community in Aimesville, which is full of venture capital, delusional founders, and one stalwart company across the street.

When Lazuli Shepherd visited the annual startup bash in Aimesville, she believed co-founders Josh Greenfield and Sally Martin shared her vision of the Dream Machine. Over the course of her first week there, she discovered that the startup was running out of cash and struggling to acheive returns required by their eccentric venture capital investors. After a series of set backs, she finds herself leading the team across the street, and bootstrapping the Dream Machine, as the startup created by Josh and Sally meets its destiny.
