# Aimless in Aimesville

Lazuli saw a rack of bikes available for rent when she exited the office building that afternoon. She instinctively swiped her card and pedaled over toward 5 mile creek. She was so sleepy that the entire scene was surreal, but her skin was crawling and there was the need to release energy. "Five miles meandering with a mazy motion," she thought, unable to recall whether that was a real line of poetry or delusion.

This was her first time seeing Aimesville outside of her brief visit for the Startup Bash and the time that she had spent working downtown. It was very different than Vermont. The bike paths were incredible, so she continued floating around town aimelessly. The itchy sensation in her skin dissipated and she was feeling euphoric now. The fever dream was lucid and delightful.

She plopped down into a bed of grass after scrambing around on some rocks. Small boulders at the base of the hills ascended fractally toward two separate peaks, one considerably higher than the other. The sun was setting between them. There was a chill in the air, and the squirrels in a nearby pine tree had begun acting crazy, the way that they do when winter is approaching. She watched them through the long blades of grass.
